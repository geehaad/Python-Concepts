# Python-Concepts

Python is a general purpose language so it is not just for data science. It can be used for web
development, mobile application, game development, et cetera.

I will give a tutorial on some of these concepts that, in my opinion, are very important for dealing with data using python.

1. Functions
2. Classes
3. Positional and keyword arguments
4. *args and **kwargs
5. Lists
6. Tuples
7. Dictionaries
8. Sets
9. List comprehension
10.Lambda expressions
